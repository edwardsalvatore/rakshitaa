        So I the last episode we have seen how Rakshita is being triggered with the psychological imbalance<br>
        which is being impacted on her happy life <br>
        and how she is feeling alone even being surrounded by too many friends!<br><br>
        In this episode let's see how she tackles the condition both mental and behavioral<br>

        Rakshita feels lonely all of a sudden and doesn't actually know how to handle the circumstances<br>
        All of her closest people whom she thought to be on her side in the times of need have betrayed her!<br><br>
        Rakshita being a girl and with innocent heart wants to cry and even cries a bit.<br>
        After being sad for along night she decides for a change to a newer version of herself<br>
        Without even thinking for second she tells herself that this is the right decision because in very deep her innocence is murdered by this cruel world.<br>
        She comes out of the depression with the ideologies which were seeded by the Harm caused to her mental health by this insane world.<br><br>
        Eventually she truns from, making more friends to just being close to only a very small number of people and she chooses only 2 people amongst the crowd!.<br>
        People around her start noticing the rapid change in her behavior and even start questioning her about her change,<br><br> who were somehow connected with all these changes in her behavior infact they were the reason for this enormous impact.<br>
        After being questioned by the people whom were literally responsible she couldn't endure more then in the little instance<br>
        Suddenly Rakshita explodes, the boundaries to her patience's breaks into pieces<br><br> she starts screaming and abusing which were not from her but the world made her do that and the world is held responsible
        After being through so much she thinks that<br><br>
        This world doesn't deserves the innocent kind hearted rakshita this is what the world deserves the newer version <br><br>who literally doesn't give a fuck to the people except a very fewer people she choose!!<br><br>
        <hr >
        Damn the world lost the kind Rakshita 
        now let the world deal with the this newer badass version ever after
        ...
